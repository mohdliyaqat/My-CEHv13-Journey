# Module 01: Introduction to Ethical Hacking

This module provides a foundational overview of information security, ethical hacking, and the frameworks that guide the entire CEH v13 curriculum.

### 1. Information Security Concepts

* **Information Security Defined:** The protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Information is a critical asset that organizations must secure.
* **Elements of Information Security:** Information security relies on five major elements:
    * **Confidentiality:** Assurance that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
    * **Integrity:** The trustworthiness of data or resources in preventing improper or unauthorized changes.
    * **Availability:** Assurance that systems for delivering, storing, and processing information are accessible when required by authorized users.
    * **Authenticity:** The characteristic of communication or data that ensures the quality of being genuine.
    * **Non-Repudiation:** A guarantee that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent it.
* **Information Security Attacks:**
    * An attack is an action performed with the intent to breach an IT system's security by exploiting its vulnerabilities.
    * The conceptual formula for an attack is: `Attacks = Motive (Goal) + Method (TTP) + Vulnerability`.
    * **Classification of Attacks:** Attacks are classified into five categories:
        * **Passive Attacks:** Involve intercepting and monitoring network traffic without tampering with the data.
        * **Active Attacks:** Tamper with data in transit or disrupt services to bypass security systems.
        * **Close-in Attacks:** Performed when the attacker is in close physical proximity to the target system.
        * **Insider Attacks:** Involve using privileged access to violate rules or cause a threat to the organization.
        * **Distribution Attacks:** Occur when attackers tamper with hardware or software prior to installation.
* **Information Warfare (InfoWar):**
    * Refers to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to gain a competitive advantage.
    * It includes both **Defensive** (strategies to defend against attacks on ICT assets) and **Offensive** (attacks against the ICT assets of an opponent) strategies.

### 2. Hacking Concepts and Hacker Classes

* **What is Hacking?**
    * Hacking refers to exploiting system vulnerabilities and compromising security controls to gain unauthorized access. It involves modifying system or application features to achieve a goal outside of the creator's original purpose.
* **Hacker Classes:** Hackers are categorized based on their activities and motivations:
    * **White Hat Hackers:** Professionals who use their hacking skills for defensive purposes, with permission from the system owner.
    * **Black Hat Hackers:** Individuals who use their skills for illegal or malicious purposes.
    * **Gray Hat Hackers:** Individuals who work both offensively and defensively at various times.
    * **Script Kiddies:** Unskilled individuals who compromise systems by running scripts and tools developed by others.
    * **Hacktivists:** Individuals or groups who use hacking as an act of protest to promote a social or political agenda.
    * **State-Sponsored Hackers:** Skilled individuals employed by a government to penetrate and damage the information systems of other governments.

### 3. Ethical Hacking Concepts and AI

* **What is Ethical Hacking?**
    * Ethical hacking is the practice of employing hacking tools and techniques to identify vulnerabilities and ensure system security. It is performed with the permission of the concerned authorities.
* **AI-Driven Ethical Hacking:**
    * AI-driven ethical hacking is a modern approach where AI technologies enhance the capabilities of ethical hackers.
    * Benefits include automation of repetitive tasks, enhanced accuracy, and predictive analysis.
    * **Myth: AI will not replace ethical hackers.** Human expertise, creativity, and critical thinking remain indispensable in cybersecurity.

### 4. Hacking Methodologies and Frameworks

* **CEH Ethical Hacking Framework:** The framework defines the step-by-step process to perform ethical hacking. It includes five phases:
    1.  **Reconnaissance:** Gathering as much information as possible about the target.
    2.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** Examining a system to identify weaknesses that can be exploited.
    3.  **Gaining Access:** The phase where actual hacking occurs and an attacker obtains access to an OS or application.
    4.  **Maintaining Access:** The attacker attempts to retain ownership of the system and its resources.
    5.  **Clearing Tracks:** Erasing all evidence of the security compromise from the system to remain undetected.
* **Cyber Kill Chain Methodology:** A component of intelligence-driven defense for the identification and prevention of malicious intrusion activities.
* **MITRE ATT&CK Framework:** A globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.
* **Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis:** A framework for identifying clusters of events that are correlated on any systems in an organization. It consists of four basic features: **Adversary, Capability, Infrastructure,** and **Victim**.

### 5. Information Security Controls and Laws

* **Defense-in-Depth:** A security strategy in which multiple protection layers are placed throughout an information system.
* **Risk Management:** The process of reducing and maintaining risk at an acceptable level.
* **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI):** The collection and analysis of information about threats and adversaries to make knowledgeable decisions for preparedness and prevention. CTI is divided into four types based on consumption: **Strategic, Tactical, Operational,** and **Technical**.
* **Laws and Standards:** The module also covers various information security laws and standards like **HIPAA** and **GDPR**.
